# How to Execute the Code

All .ipynb notebooks are dependent on the dataset being mounted via Google Drive. In order to run the code, prime_data needs to exist in the corresponding Google Drive. Once that folder has been uploaded, the first cell of the notebooks can be ran, which mounts the drive, allowing /content/drive/MyDrive/prime_data to be accessible to the rest of the code. From there, the code can be ran cell by cell.
